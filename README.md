## How to install Cypress

Note: As of 10.11.2016 Cypress still only works on Linux and OSX.

Cypress is currently in early access. To get it you first need a Github account. Then go to https://www.cypress.io and apply for early access by entering the same e-mail that is associated with your Github account.

Then install cypress-cli via NPM. After that the GUI can be installed using the cypress-cli.

```
npm install -g cypress-cli
cypress install
```

Now open the Cypress GUI and log in with your Github account. Finally you're good to go!
